print("Hello")

# There are lots of different data type:

print(name)
# To combine with a stiring, we use f-strings
# The variables goes inside curly brackets
print(f"My dog is called{name} and he is {age} years old")

# We use input() to get input from the user
input("What is your name?")
#print hello to the user and ask them how old they are
